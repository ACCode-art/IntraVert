                  The most important conversations you’ll ever have are the ones
                  you’ll have with yourself. You wake up with them, you walk
                  around with them, you go to bed with them, and eventually, you
                  act on them. Whether they be good or bad. We are all our own
                  worst haters and doubters because self-doubt is a natural
                  reaction to any bold attempt to change your life for the
                  better. You can’t stop it from blooming in your brain, but you
                  can neutralize it, and all the other external chatter by
                  asking, What if? Life is one big tug of war between mediocrity
                  and trying to find your best self. It’s easier to accept the
                  fact that you’re just not good enough. We all have a lot more
                  than we think we have. In life, there is no gift as overlooked
                  or inevitable as failure. I’ve had quite a few and have
                  learned to relish them because if you do the forensics you’ll
                  find clues about where to make adjustments and how to
                  eventually accomplish your task. You gotta start your journey.
                  It may suck, but eventually, you will come out the other side
                  on top. It’s easier to accept the fact that you’re just not
                  good enough. We all have a lot more than we think we have.
                  Then I thought of an English middle-distance runner from back
                  in the day named Roger Bannister. When Bannister was trying to
                  break the four-minute mile in the 1950s, experts told him it
                  couldn’t be done, but that didn’t stop him. He failed again
                  and again, but he persevered, and when he ran his historic
                  mile in 3:59.4 on May 6, 1954, he didn’t just break a record,
                  he broke open the floodgates simply by proving it possible.
